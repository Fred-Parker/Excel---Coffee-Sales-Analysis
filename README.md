# Coffee Sales Analysis (Excel) - Processing & Visualising Data

My objective during this project was to create an **intuitive dashboard showcasing key insights from a coffee shop's sales** and provide analysis. This project includes revenue trends, preferred payment methods, and the coffee orders that are both most popular and generate the highest revenue. By **presenting this data in a user-friendly and visually compelling way**, the dashboard enables **actionable business decisions** to optimise sales and customer experience.

<h2 id="methodology / approach">Methodology / Approach</h2>

<li>Data Cleaning: Standardised the data, verified correct data types, and removed duplicates.</li>
<li>Exploratory Analysis: Calculated the minimum, maximum, and average brew prices, along with total recorded sales transactions.</li>
<li>Analysis: Measured order popularity, identified top revenue-generating coffee orders, and tracked total orders over time.</li>
<li>Visualisation: Used charts and graphs to highlight key insights, making trends and patterns easy to spot.</li>

<h2 id="key findings">Key Findings</h2>

<li>October's peak in revenue and orders might align with seasonal promotions or higher consumer spending during autumn, while the smaller surge in May could relate to spring events or holidays. Conversely, January's slump likely reflects post-holiday spending dips, and April’s low sales could be tied to fewer seasonal events.</li>
<li>The dominance of card payments suggests a preference for cashless transactions, potentially due to convenience or local trends.</li>
<li>The popularity of the Americano with Milk and Latte highlights customer preferences for versatile, creamy options, while the lower demand for Espresso and Cocoa may reflect niche tastes. The Latte’s dominance in revenue underscores the impact of pricing strategy, despite the Americano’s higher order volume.</li>
<li>Trends like these can guide targeted promotions, product pricing, and inventory planning to optimise sales and customer satisfaction.</li>

<h2 id="conclusions & insights">Conclusions & Insights</h2>

<li>To further increase sales during January, consider introducing limited-time winter-themed coffee flavours, such as spiced lattes or peppermint mochas, to attract seasonal interest and boost foot traffic. Coupling this with promotions like “buy one, get one free” or loyalty rewards can incentivise repeat visits.</li>
<li>For April's drop in sales, diversifying menu offerings could reduce reliance on coffee. Introduce snacks or seasonal pastries to pair with teas, catering to a broader customer base. Additionally, fostering partnerships with regional coffee suppliers may mitigate supply chain disruptions caused by smaller harvests, ensuring consistent stock levels.</li>
<li>Leveraging targeted marketing campaigns, like email or social media ads, to highlight these initiatives can further enhance customer engagement and drive sales growth.</li>

<hr>
<h2 id="challenges & limitations">Challenges & Limitations</h2>

<li>The absence of data on coffee bean types and suppliers limited the analysis, making it harder to pinpoint the cause of April's revenue dip. Including these details could reveal how specific bean varieties or supplier challenges, like price fluctuations or quality issues, influence sales. </li>
<li>With this information, the coffee shop could better address supply disruptions or explore targeted strategies, such as diversifying bean sources or promoting high-demand varieties, to mitigate revenue losses.</li>
